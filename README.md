# Ratio Converter
### Conversion calculator between different types of musical ratios: fractions, integers (archaic ratios), ascending, descending and mixed series + custom unit of measurement (Hertz).

Conventionally, musicians employ symbols for musical elements in the form of names (G or Sol, Pa, Κε/Ke), measuring units (cents, śrutis, moria) and graphical notes (musical notes, swaralipi, neumes).

These symbols represent number-relations and are defined through RATIOS. The numerical essence of musical entities comes not from convention, but from the quantifiable nature of sound.

Musical ratios can be written in different ways, while keeping their relative values constant. Human perception of pitch is logarithmic, so diferences between members of a series are calculated by division. No matter how they are represented numerically, differences in pitch do not change.
